# Vaults

Vaults can be any smart contract integration of GHO which defines the allocation of GHO tokens amongst entities (users, groups, protocols, autonomous agents).

Put another way: a GHO vault is a smart contract which holds GHO tokens and contains logic to define the who, what, where, and how interactions can happen between entities and tokens.

The vaults prize category is seeking projects to leverage composability and verifiability of smart contract agreements to enable new use cases for GHO.

## Ideas

- ERC-4626 wrapper for GHO borrowing or LP strategies
- Vault contract to facilitate credit delegation agreements
  - Undercollateralized or alternative forms of collateral such as NFTs
- Smart contract wallet integrated with Aave protocol facilitator
