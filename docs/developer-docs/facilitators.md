# Facilitators

The GHO token has a simple yet flexible design. See for yourself by viewing the [contract source](https://etherscan.deth.net/token/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f).

The core mechanism of the GHO contract is _facilitators_. A facilitator is an address with the ability to mint GHO up to a specified threshold. Facilitators can only be approved by Aave Governance through on-chain proposal voting.

The initial proposal for GHO launched two faciltiators: Aave Protocol and Flashmint. The Aave Protocol facilitator operates similarly to borrowing a standard Aave reserve token: the `borrow` function is called but in the case of GHO, liquidity is minted instead of being allocated from token suppliers.

The flashmint facilitator operates simiarly to the `flashloan` functionality of the Aave Protocol, enabling GHO to be minted and burned within a single transaction.

The generic nature of the GHO facilitator model creates a large design space for potential facilitators, some ideas are listed below.

## Ideas

- Existing DeFi protocols as potential facilitator
- New facilitator protocol to acheive strategic goal for Aave DAO: peg stability, treasury management, etc.
- Interest rate or bonding curve mechanisms (potential upgrade to Aave Protocol facilitator or entirely new facilitator)
- Systems for verifying off-chain collateral
